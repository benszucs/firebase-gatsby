# Gatsby starter with firebase authentication and admin portal

Having created a number of gatsby blogs using headless CMS systems I feel like now is the perfect time to level up my skills and create a starter project that can be used for a website that needs a client portal. This project should serve as reference to how to set up a website using Gatsby SSG, Firebase auth, database & cloud functions.

### Research
This starter closely follows the following tutorial & starter projects, but I'm thinking of introducting cloud functions to the mix.
- Tutorial: https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/
- Starter: https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/react-gatsby-firebase-authentication

### Notes
1. Install & strip gatsby starter `gatsby new firebase-gatsby`
2. Set up the folder structure: we will need: Landing page, Layout component, Navigation with links, Private page, Account Page, Admin Page, Sign-in, Sign-up & password forget pages.
